            1. ACCEPTANCE OF TERMS
1.1. Agreement to Terms By accessing, browsing, registering for, or using the Emirates Group Roblox ("EGR", "we", "us", or "our") website, portals, and associated services (collectively, the "Services"), you ("User", "you", or "your") explicitly agree to be bound by these Terms of Service ("Terms"). If you do not agree to these Terms, you must immediately cease all use of our Services.

1.2. Virtual Nature of Services You explicitly acknowledge and agree that Emirates Group Roblox is a virtual aviation organization operating exclusively on the Roblox platform. We are a fan-based, roleplay community and are NOT affiliated, associated, authorized, endorsed by, or in any way officially connected with the real-world Emirates Group, Emirates Airline, flydubai, dnata, or any of their subsidiaries or affiliates. All trademarks, logos, and brand names are the property of their respective real-world owners and are used here under the principles of fair use for roleplay and simulation purposes.

You agree to notify Emirates Group Roblox administration immediately of any unauthorized use of your account. EGR will not be liable for any loss or damage arising from your failure to protect your account information.

2.3. Account Linking Our Services may utilize third-party APIs (such as RoVer or Bloxlink) to verify your Roblox identity. By using these features, you consent to the retrieval of your public Roblox data (username, user ID, group rank) for verification purposes.

3. CODE OF CONDUCT AND COMMUNITY STANDARDS
