            1. INTRODUCTION
1.1. Purpose Emirates Group Roblox ("EGR", "we", "us", or "our") values the privacy of our members. This Privacy Policy outlines how we collect, use, store, and protect the information you provide when using our website, crew center, and associated tools (collectively, the "Services").

1.2. Virtual Organization Disclaimer Please note that Emirates Group Roblox is a virtual aviation community on the Roblox platform. We are not the real Emirates Group. This policy applies strictly to data collected within our virtual ecosystem and does not supersede the privacy policies of the Roblox Corporation or Discord Inc.

2. INFORMATION WE COLLECT
We collect minimal information necessary to facilitate your participation in our virtual airline.

2.1. Information You Provide

Registration Data: When you link your account or apply for a position, we collect your Roblox Username, Roblox User ID, and Discord Username/ID.

Operational Data: If you submit flight logs, we collect data regarding your virtual flights (e.g., departure/arrival airports, flight time, aircraft type, and notes).

Application Content: Information included in job applications (e.g., essays, availability, timezone). Do not submit real-world personal sensitive data (e.g., real full name, home address, phone number) in these forms.

2.2. Automatically Collected Information

Roblox Public Data: We access publicly available data from the Roblox API, such as your current rank in the "Emirates Group Roblox" group and account age, to verify eligibility.

Log Data: Our servers may automatically log basic technical information such as your IP address (for security and anti-exploit purposes), browser type, and timestamps of your visits.

3. HOW WE USE YOUR INFORMATION
We use your data solely for the administration and operation of the virtual airline:

Identity Verification: To confirm you own the Roblox account you are claiming and to ensure you hold the correct rank within our Roblox group.

Career Progression: To track your flight hours, activity points, and training history, which are used to determine promotions and awards.

Communication: To contact you via Discord regarding application status, disciplinary actions, or organizational announcements.

Security: To detect and prevent fraud, exploiting, or multiple account abuse within our systems.

4. DATA SHARING AND DISCLOSURE
4.1. No Sale of Data We do never sell, trade, or rent your personal identification information to outside parties.

4.2. Publicly Visible Information Given the social nature of this organization, certain information is considered public profile data within our Crew Center:

Your Roblox Username and Avatar.

Your EGR Rank and Position.

Your total flight hours and activity statistics.

4.3. Third-Party Service Providers We may use trusted third-party services to operate our systems. These providers have access to your information only to perform specific tasks on our behalf:

Roblox Corporation: For authentication and group data.

Discord: For communication and logging via webhooks.

Database Providers (e.g., Supabase/Firebase): For secure data storage.

5. DATA STORAGE AND SECURITY
5.1. Security Measures We implement appropriate technical security measures to protect your data against unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction. This includes encrypted connections (SSL) and restricted access to our backend databases.

5.2. Data Retention We retain your user profile and flight history for as long as you are a member of Emirates Group Roblox. If you leave the organization or are discharged, we may retain your core disciplinary and flight logs for historical archiving and ban-evasion prevention.

6. COOKIES AND TRACKING
Our website may use "cookies" or local storage to enhance your experience (e.g., keeping you logged in). You can choose to set your web browser to refuse cookies, but note that some parts of the Crew Center (such as flight logging) may not function properly without them.

7. CHILDREN'S PRIVACY
Our Services are intended for users of the Roblox platform. We do not knowingly collect "Personal Identifiable Information" (PII) such as real names, physical addresses, or school names from children under 13. If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child has provided us with real-world personal data, please contact us immediately, and we will delete it.

8. YOUR RIGHTS
8.1. Access and Correction You have the right to view the data we hold on you (visible via your profile) and request corrections to inaccuracies (e.g., incorrect flight hours).

8.2. Right to be Forgotten You may request the deletion of your EGR account data. Please note that requesting deletion will result in the forfeiture of your rank, flight hours, and history within the organization. To request deletion, contact a High Rank via Discord.

9. CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY
Emirates Group Roblox has the discretion to update this privacy policy at any time. When we do, we will revise the updated date at the top of this page. We encourage Users to frequently check this page for any changes.

10. CONTACT US
If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy or your dealings with this website, please contact the EGR Legal & Administration Team via our official Discord Server.
