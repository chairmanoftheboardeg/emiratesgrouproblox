          <h3>Why EGR exists</h3>
          <p class="muted">
            We built EGR to set a higher standard for virtual aviation. The goal is a corporate-grade operating model where every division has a defined mandate and where execution is consistent across operations.
          </p>
          <p class="muted">
            Our approach prioritises structure, clear responsibilities, and disciplined coordination, supported by governance and safety culture.

          <h3>Professional culture</h3>
          <p class="muted">
            Culture is defined by behaviour. We expect respectful communication, consistency in execution, and compliance with standards. This is how we protect the environment and maintain quality over time.
